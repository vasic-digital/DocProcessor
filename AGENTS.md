# AGENTS.md — Doc-Processor

## INHERITED FROM constitution/AGENTS.md

All rules in `constitution/AGENTS.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md` it references) apply unconditionally. This file's rules below extend them — they MUST NOT weaken any inherited rule. Use `constitution/find_constitution.sh` from the parent project root to resolve the absolute path of the submodule from any nested location.

## INHERITED FROM the Helix Constitution

This module is governed by the Helix Constitution. All rules in the
constitution's `AGENTS.md` and the `Constitution.md` it references apply
unconditionally. Locate the constitution from any nested depth via its
`find_constitution.sh` helper — do NOT hardcode a path (this module stays
fully decoupled and project-agnostic per §11.4.28).

## Module Overview

DocProcessor is a standalone, project-not-aware, fully decoupled Go module
(`digital.vasic.docprocessor`, Go 1.25) that loads project documentation,
builds structured feature maps, and tracks verification coverage for QA
automation. It supports LLM-driven feature extraction via an injected agent
and also provides heuristic extraction for offline use. The module imports no
consuming-project namespace; project-specific behaviour is injected at runtime
through the `Translator`, `LLMAgent`, and `Config` contracts.

## Responsibilities

- Load and parse documentation (`pkg/loader`: Markdown, YAML, HTML, AsciiDoc,
  RST).
- Extract features and build a queryable `FeatureMap` (`pkg/feature`).
- Track per-feature verification coverage thread-safely (`pkg/coverage`).
- Build a directed inter-document link graph with JSON/Mermaid export
  (`pkg/docgraph`).
- Define the `LLMAgent` extraction contract and prompt templates (`pkg/llm`),
  with no hard dependency on any LLM provider.
- Externalise all user-facing strings (`pkg/i18n`) and load configuration
  (`pkg/config`).
- Expose a CLI: `docprocessor [--verbose|-v] <docs-directory>`.

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...                      # build all packages + CLI
go test ./...                       # unit + integration + stress + security + E2E + automation
go test ./... -race -count=1        # with race detection
go build -o bin/docprocessor ./cmd/docprocessor
```

`make test`, `make test-race`, and `make test-cover` wrap the above. The CLI
runs as `docprocessor [--verbose|-v] <docs-directory>`.

## Package Structure

Seven packages under `pkg/`, plus the CLI under `cmd/docprocessor`:

| Package        | Purpose                                                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pkg/loader`   | Document loading + parsing (Markdown, YAML, HTML, AsciiDoc, RST)     |
| `pkg/feature`  | Feature extraction + `FeatureMap` building (`DefaultBuilder`)        |
| `pkg/coverage` | Thread-safe (`RWMutex`) coverage tracking                           |
| `pkg/docgraph` | Directed inter-document link graph with JSON/Mermaid export          |
| `pkg/llm`      | `LLMAgent` interface + prompt templates (no provider dependency)     |
| `pkg/config`   | Configuration loading from `.env` files / maps                      |
| `pkg/i18n`     | `Translator` contract + `NoopTranslator` default                    |

## Key Interfaces

- `loader.Loader` — load `loader.Document` values from the filesystem;
  `SupportedFormats()` reports handled extensions.
- `feature.FeatureMapBuilder` — `NewBuilder(projectRoot)` returns a
  `DefaultBuilder`; `BuildFromDocs(ctx, docs)` produces a `*FeatureMap`.
- `coverage.CoverageTracker` — `NewTracker()`; concurrency-safe verification
  status tracking.
- `llm.LLMAgent` — injected LLM for intelligent extraction; no hard
  dependency on any provider.
- `i18n.Translator` — externalised user-facing strings; `NoopTranslator`
  returns the message ID verbatim as a loud fallback.
- `config.Config` — `LoadFromEnv(path)` / `LoadFromMap(env)`.

## Testing Boundaries

- Build: `go build ./...`. Vet: `go vet ./...` (zero warnings).
- Tests: `go test ./... -race -count=1` covers unit, integration, stress,
  security, E2E, and automation suites.
- Integration/stress/security/E2E/automation tests run against real
  filesystems and the real CLI binary, not mocks; unit tests may use mocks.
- Agents MUST NOT weaken, stub, or skip tests, and MUST NOT introduce a
  dependency on any consuming project. Every change keeps build and vet green.

## Module-Specific Conventions

- Decoupling: never import a consumer namespace under `pkg/**` or `cmd/**`.
- All user-facing CLI output is emitted through the injected `Translator`
  (message IDs live in `pkg/i18n/bundles/active.en.yaml`), never as hardcoded
  English literals.
- `.env` is git-ignored and must be `chmod 600`; only `.env.example` is
  committed.
- `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` must pass with zero warnings.

## Constitutional Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (CONST-035 / §11.9, inherited)

> Verbatim user mandate: *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*
>
> Operative rule: **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

This anchor is inherited from the Helix Constitution (`constitution/Constitution.md` §11.9 / CONST-035); resolve it via `constitution/find_constitution.sh` from the parent project root. This submodule stays fully decoupled and project-not-aware (§11.4.28) — this is generic governance inheritance only, never project-specific context.
